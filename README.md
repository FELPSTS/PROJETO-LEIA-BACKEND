# LEIA 

### LEIA: Uma plataforma de documentação automática e organização inteligente de códigos.

#### LEIA is a platform integrated with AI tools that uses APIs to process and record programming code, transforming it into organized documentation. It structures both general project information, such as its purpose, and more technical details, including classes, objects, and parameters. Additionally, the platform analyzes and quantifies these elements directly from the code, making project understanding and maintenance more practical and accessible.
#### Beyond automated documentation, LEIA also features a group system, allowing managers to track the progress of documentation within a company. For solo developers, the platform offers a sharing system, enabling them to easily share documentation or even the code itself with others within the LEIA environment.

Features

* Automatic documentation: Generates detailed descriptions of the code, including classes, objects, and parameters.

* Intelligent analysis: Extracts and organizes information directly from the code, making it easier to understand.

* Group system: Allows managers to track the progress of documentation in real-time, fostering collaboration.

* Integrated sharing: Makes it easy to share documentation and code among platform members.

* API integration: Supports various tools and services to optimize the development process.

* Technologies: Built with React on the front-end, Node.js for back-end and SQL for handling relational databases.

LEIA was created as part of the final project for the technical course in Systems Analysis and Development. The idea was to develop a platform that not only generates documentation automatically but also facilitates collaboration and organization within development teams.
